# git-extensions

This repository serves to house various git-scripts, or extensions to git,
deemed useful by the author and community.

## Installation

Generally speaking, you should be able to grab the executable(s) within an
extension's directory, plop it somewhere in your `PATH`, and be good to go.
Each extension has its own `README` where further installation instructions,
gotchas, or other notes are contained, so be sure to read those if you run
into any issues.
